                The U.S. is about to return to the Moon in a big way. NASA has announced one of the first steps in the next generation of lunar exploration: a landing site for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER).

The site is on the western edge of Nobile crater, near the lunar south pole. The crater was named after Italian polar explorer Umberto Nobile. The targeted area of study covers 93 square kilometers (36 square miles); VIPER, which is set to launch in 2023, is expected to traverse 16 to 24 km (10-15 miles) during its primary mission.

The three other finalists in the running in the same region included Haworth Crater, a ridge that runs between Shackleton and de Gerlache craters, and Shoemaker Crater.

The U.S. is about to return to the Moon in a big way. NASA has announced one of the first steps in the next generation of lunar exploration: a landing site for the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER).

The site is on the western edge of Nobile crater, near the lunar south pole. The crater was named after Italian polar explorer Umberto Nobile. The targeted area of study covers 93 square kilometers (36 square miles); VIPER, which is set to launch in 2023, is expected to traverse 16 to 24 km (10-15 miles) during its primary mission.

The three other finalists in the running in the same region included Haworth Crater, a ridge that runs between Shackleton and de Gerlache craters, and Shoemaker Crater.



NASA based the final site selection on four criteria: Earth visibility, which is necessary for direct line-of-sight communication; sunlight access, for solar power; terrain, for flexibility during traverse; and the scientific value of a site expected to contain water ice.

                <b> What’s a decision-maker?</b><br>
                In our parlance, a “decision-maker” is not that stakeholder or investor who swoops in to veto the
                machinations of the project team, but rather the person who is responsible for decision architecture and
                context framing. In other words, a creator of meticulously-phrased objectives as opposed to their
                destroyer.

                “Once on the lunar surface, VIPER will provide ground truth measurements for the presence of water and other resources at the Moon’s south pole,” said NASA's associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen (NASA-HQ) in a recent press release. “The data VIPER returns will provide lunar scientists around the world with further insight into our Moon’s cosmic origin, evolution and history.”

“Once on the lunar surface, VIPER will provide ground truth measurements for the presence of water and other resources at the Moon’s south pole,” said NASA's associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen (NASA-HQ) in a recent press release. “The data VIPER returns will provide lunar scientists around the world with further insight into our Moon’s cosmic origin, evolution and history.”



VIPER will search for water ice on the lunar surface in permanently shadowed regions around the lunar south pole. The science collected by VIPER will not only help predict where ice might be present on the Moon, based on similar terrain, but will also help define a global resource map.

The mission will visit at least six separate sites of interest during exploration, and drill and sample in at least three locations. Unlike Perseverance and Curiosity on Mars, communications with VIPER will be carried out from Earth in near full-time.

“Our evaluation of the landing site was driven by science priorities,” says Anthony Colaprete (NASA-Ames Research Center) in a recent press release. “We seek answers to some pretty complex questions and studying these resources on the Moon that have stood the test of time will help us answer them.”

The primary mission duration is planned to last 100 days, powered by solar-charged batteries. The 430-kilogram (950-pound) rover is currently under development at NASA's Ames Research Center.

                <h1>ICE ON THE MOON</h1>
                Missions such as India’s Chandrayaan 1 orbiter and NASA’s Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) have detected tantalizing evidence for the existence of hydroxide at the lunar poles, hinting at the presence of water ice in permanently shaded regions such as crater floors. Large deposits of water ice strewn on the surface as a result of ancient cometary impacts could be a valuable in situ resource for future astronauts.

Instruments aboard VIPER are designed to find ice on the surface or below. A percussive drilling mechanism, dubbed the Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploring New Terrains (TRIDENT), holds on to deposits of material, bringing them up and depositing them on the surface for further close-up analysis.

VIPER has three instruments to analyze volatiles (such as water ice) and mineral composition, including the Mass Spectrometer Observing Lunar Operations; the Near Infrared Volatiles Spectrometer System, which will include a context camera to watch the drill during deployment; and the Neutron Spectrometer System which can detect water down to a sensitivity of 10 of parts per million.

VIPER will also include navcams on top masts, stereo cameras, and hazcams for hazardous terrain avoidance. Expect VIPER to document a unique perpetual twilight landscape quite unlike previous lunar landers, with boulders casting long stark shadows in the distance.

Unlike the rocker-bogie wheel system used on Curiosity and Perseverance, VIPER has four wheels each with independent suspension and active steering, meaning it can "crab walk" sideways. VIPER also has two different speed regimes: a slow 10 cm per second (4 inches per second) during science operations, and twice that speed for moving from point-to-point.
